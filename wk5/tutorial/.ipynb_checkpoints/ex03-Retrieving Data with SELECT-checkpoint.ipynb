    "\n",
    "When working with databases and SQL, the most common task is to request data from one or more tables, which returns this data in the form of a result table. These result tables are called result-sets. The ***SELECT*** statement accomplishes this. In most applications, ***SELECT*** is the most commonly used data query language (DQL) command. Moreover, the ***SELECT*** can do far more than simply retrieve and display data and I will show you in the following sections.\n",
